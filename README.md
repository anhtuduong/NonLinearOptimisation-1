# Introduction

In April 1912, the Titanic set out from Southampton to New York City, picking
up passengers in Cherbourg and Queenstown before venturing across the Atlantic. The ship famously never made it to New York. On the night of 14 April,
the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank a few hours later. More than 1500 of the
estimated 2224 passengers and crew on board perished.
Whether a passenger survived was not just a matter of luck. In this assignment, we will try to predict which passengers were likely to survive.
